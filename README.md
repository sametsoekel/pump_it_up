 ## Notes day-to-day
 
 ### 14 September 2020
 
 -   Feature `construction_year` has many of zeros to indicate NA's they need some interest.
 
 -   Because the feature `scheme_name` has %47 missing variables, rid it off.
 
 -   After ridding off unnecesary features (it may change!), there is no observations with over 20% deficiency rate
